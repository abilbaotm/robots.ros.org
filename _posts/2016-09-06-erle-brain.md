# Erle-Brain 2

''ROS Software Maintainer: [Erle Robotics](http://erlerobotics.com)''

## Overview
Erle-Brain 2 is an all-in-one tiny Linux brain (with autopilot capabilities embedded) for making robots and drones.

Since we made Erle-Brain we’ve got a lot of feedback on what’s most used and useful for users. With this in mind we are happy to announce we have released a new version of our brain: [Erle-Brain 2](http://erlerobotics.com/blog/product/erle-brain-v2/), a more powerful unit, smaller, faster and cheaper brain for building robots and drones.

Erle-Brain 2 ships with a cost of 199 €, includes a quad-core Cortex-A7 with all the sensors needed to create copters, rovers, planes or even hexapods. It includes integrated optional 1080 HD 5MP camera, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 3G/4G networks, USB, Ethernet, I2C, HDMI and UART.

Erle-Brain 2 comes with a Debian image flashed, it uses the [APM autopilot](http://ardupilot.com/) and has ROS Indigo preinstalled including the mavros package which exposes many of the APM features on ROS interfaces.
